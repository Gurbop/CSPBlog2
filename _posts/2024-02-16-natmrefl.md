## Glows and Grows
- During N@TM the projects and code were demoed well
- all the code was exlpained in a good way as well. 
- We can improve our project by incporporating more navigation from users and organizing how our features are connected better.
- We can do this by adding buttons that lead to other features based on their purpose.
## Improving
- Based on feedback I want to incorporate more user interaction between feature and user. Many adaults alaso didnt fully understand what our project was about. To fix this we can add a help page that summarizes what the game is and how our features relate to it. This gives users background understanding of what is going on. We can also demosntrate what our project is based on as not everyone will no what Clash Royale is. I would also like to add better formating to  my feature where data can be displayed in a table format.
## Other Projects
- One project I saw was based on jobs. When you signup you have the option to be a freelancer or employer. You can create or aaply for jobs as well as see al the applicants. I also enjoyed the creativity of many of the photography projects
