## Corections:

## Question 22
<html>
<img src="/CspBlog2/images/q22.png">
</html>
Reflection: My choice is wrong because the rotation occurs before moving forward. If this happens before the robot moves forward it will move in a different direction and will not end up in the top of the grid. The correct answer is A.

## Question 25
<html>
<img src="/CspBlog2/images/q25.png">
</html>
Reflection: My choice is wrong because the code segment will return the sum of numbers n times. This is because every time the code is ran the function happens until J>n and 1 is added each time to the value of j. Result is being combined with j and is returned each time the function is ran. When j>n the output wil be 1...n. The correct answer is D.

## Question 55
<html>

</html>
Reflection: The INSERT(utensil, 1, temp) line is required so that the last element of the list is moved to the beginning of the list. The anser I chose assigns the value of the last element of the list to the variable temp, then removes the last element of the list, then appends temp to the end of the list. This outputs the original list without any change. The correct answer is C.

## Question 57
<html>
<img src="/CspBlog2/images/q57.png">
</html>
Reflection: When parallel computing occurs you need to create a combination so the time is closest to each other. This optimizes the time because it runs for the least amount of time as one processer is not waiting for the other. My choice was 50 and 25 seconds, so the overall runtime was 50 seconds. The correct answer A does it in 40 seconds.

## Question 64
<html>
<img src="/CspBlog2/images/q64.png">
</html>
Reflection: Lines B and C should be removed so the code works as intended. This is becasue you are returning the wrong result value at line 8 and at line 10 result is being assigned to adault which will override if they are senior citizen. This statment should occur in an else at the end of the function.

## Question 68
<html>
<img src="/CspBlog2/images/q68.png">
</html>
Reflection: A and C will not produce intended results as in list A the code will iterate over myList from right to left, removing each element that is equal in value to the element immediately preceding it. For this list, the code segment will remove the sixth element (10), the fourth element (20), and the second element (10). This results in the list [10, 20, 10], which still contains duplicates. For C it won't work because when the list is iterated through list[2] wont be compared with list[5], so the duplicate 40's will remain in the list after the fintion is ran.

## Unfamiliar Terms

<p>Lossy compression:  used to compress multimedia data (audio, video, and images)</p>
<p>Parallel Computing: Parallel computing refers to the process of breaking down larger problems into smaller, independent, often similar parts that can be executed simultaneously by multiple processors communicating via shared memory, the results of which are combined upon completion as part of an overall algorithm.</p>

## Conclusion
Skills to work on: 1.B, 4.C, 1.D, 2.B, and 4.B
I scored a 64/70 which shows my growth of knowledgge throughout the year. Leading up to the AP exam I will continue to do practice MCQ's whith a focus on runtime, and outputs for given sudo code. I will also make sure I understand all of  the college board sudo code notation. There are many questions I now feel more comfortable about answering after the team teches throughout the year. This MCQ was great practice and I will continue to practice and learn to get a 5 on the AP examp.
