<p>Score: 64/66</p>
<p>Corrections: adjusted = Max(midterm, finalexam) + finalexam This will replace the midterm with the final score if it is greater and add the final exam score which will give us the total score. I got this wrong because I left out the + finalexam thinking they just wanted the adjusted using the mac.</p>
