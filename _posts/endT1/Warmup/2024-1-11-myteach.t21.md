<p>Redundancy</p>
<p>The Internet is fault tolerant and has been made to withstand errors or problems that may occur. It does this by using redundancy. Redundancy is the inclusion of extra components in order to mitigate the failure of one part of the system. One method of to achieve this is having multiple paths between connected devices allowing transfers to have alternative routes. If a route fails the data will be sent down a different path. Fault tolerance allows users to use a network even if there are system failures. One example where redundancy wasnâ€™t present was the backend during the night at the museum. The pathway to transfer data likely broke, and there was no redundancy to allow for an alternative path.</p>

<p>What would make this network fault-tolerant. A, a connection from a to b?</p>
