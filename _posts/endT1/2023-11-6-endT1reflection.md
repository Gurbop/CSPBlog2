<p>This trimester I have learned PSUEDO and coding basics like libraries, simulations, procedures, algorithms, data abstraction, lists strings, mathmatical expressions, and logic gates.I learned about using js and python. Next trimester I want to learn how to use aws and flask in backend.</p>
<p>Student Teaching:</p>
<p>Variables and Assingments: these are used to assingn values to be stored in code. Operations can be performed on these values and executed.</p>
<p>Data Abstraction: JSON is used to represent structured data, and we can convert strings to JSON and vice versa using the json module.</p>
<p>Data Abstraction: focusing on the key elements(values). Use lists, classes and dictionaries to store important data.</p>
<p>Mathmatical Expressions: can be perfomred using certain syntax, value comparisons can also be made</p>
<p>Strings: store text, can be concated, edited</p>
<p>De Morgan's Law: De Morganâ€™s Law can change statements from AND to OR by negating terms.</p>
<p>Boolean: trueor fasle, 1 or 0</p>
<p>Iteration: cycle through lists using loops to idetify certain values of interest.</p>
<p>Algorithms/Procedures: can be used to repeat a set of actions sets of code that perofm and action</p>
<p>Libraries: Libraries import files that contain large procedures to perform complicated tasks. Make code simpler and less repetative.</p>
