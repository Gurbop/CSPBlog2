## Insertion Sort
- time complexity is N^2
- the unsorted element will be popped out and the list shifts one spot over to create  a space for the object that must be sorted into the correct spot.
- the sorted object is compared with the other elements of the list to determine the correct spot
## Quick Sort
- splits array into 2 sub arrays one less and greater
- recursion happens until array is fully sorted
- time complexity n*log(n)

## Bubble Sort
- best 0n worst 0 n^2
- compares 2 elements and they swithc positions depending on value
- starts by comparing 1,2 and then after full cycle starts again at 0
## Merge Sort
- time complexity O^nlog(n)
- list is split into paurs of two
- groups of 2 are sorted, then groups of 4
- the 2 halves are sorted and then put together and sorted
## Selection Sort
- minumum value selected and moved to the front of list 
- repeat process for the number of elements in a list
- time complexity O^2
