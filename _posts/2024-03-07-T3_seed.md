## CPT Project Feature:
My feature displays data from the game clash royale in a easy way the user can interact with. The user can see the leaderboard from any given season, active tournaments, and the current challanges running. All data specific data like, tournament requirments, rewards, players, and player info like, clan, trophies, and rank will be displayed.

## CPT Writeup:
## Meeting College Board Requirments:

## Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online datas stream, a file:
When a user presses the search button it will send a request to the clash royale api and get data based on what the user asks for. For example if the user searches for season 1, the table will be populated with data for the season 1 leaderboards.

## Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the users purpose.
list of data based on user input(season), that contains the information applied to the table
~~~
def get_leaderboard():
    season = request.args.get('season', '1')  # Default to season 1 if not specified
    url = f'https://api.clashroyale.com/v1/locations/global/seasons/{season}/rankings/players?limit=10'
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}'}
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.ok:
        return jsonify(response.json().get('items', []))  # Send back a list of items
~~~
## At least one procedure that contirubted to the programâ€™s intened purpose where you have defined: the name, return type, one or more parameters
name: fetch_challanges_
return value: a list of challange data or an error mesage when recieving data 
~~~
def fetch_challenges():
    url = f"https://api.clashroyale.com/v1/challenges"
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}'}
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.ok:
        data = response.json()
        challenges_list = []
        for item in data:
            challenges_list.extend(item.get('challenges', []))
        return jsonify(challenges_list)
    else:
        return jsonify({"error": "Failed to fetch data"}), response.status_code
~~~
## An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure
This iterates throught the list of data and assigns them to a part of the table where it is outputed and displayed.
~~~
    data.forEach(function(tournament) {
    $('#tournamentTable tbody').append(`
    <tr>
        <td>${tournament.name}</td>
        <td>${tournament.description}</td>
        <td>${tournament.status}</td>
        <td>${tournament.levelCap}</td>
        <td>${tournament.firstPlaceCardPrize}</td>
        <td>${tournament.capacity} / ${tournament.maxCapacity}</td>
        <td>${tournament.preparationDuration} seconds</td>
        <td>${tournament.duration} seconds</td>
        <td>${new Date(tournament.createdTime).toLocaleString()}</td>
        <td>${tournament.gameMode && tournament.gameMode.id ? tournament.gameMode.id : ''}</td>
        </tr>
        `);
~~~
## Calls to your student-developed prodcedure:
This takes the tournament the user is searching for and puts that value into the procedure.
~~~
$('#searchForm').submit(function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    let tournamentName = $('#tournamentName').val();
    fetchTournaments(tournamentName);
    fetchChallenges();
});
~~~
## Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or ) based on input and program functionality: 
This function takes the data recieved and outputs it in the form of a table.
~~~
 <div id="tournaments-list">
        <h2>Tournaments</h2>
        <table id="tournamentTable">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                    <th>Status</th>
                    <th>Level Cap</th>

                    <th>Created Time</th>
                    <th>Game Mode ID</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>

function fetchTournaments(tournamentName) {
    $.getJSON(`${backendUrl}/tournaments?name=${encodeURIComponent(tournamentName)}`, function(data) {
    $('#tournamentTable tbody').empty();
    data.forEach(function(tournament) {
    $('#tournamentTable tbody').append(`
    <tr>
        <td>${tournament.name}</td>
        <td>${tournament.description}</td>
        <td>${tournament.status}</td>
        <td>${tournament.levelCap}</td>
        <td>${tournament.firstPlaceCardPrize}</td>

        <td>${tournament.duration} seconds</td>
        <td>${new Date(tournament.createdTime).toLocaleString()}</td>

        </tr>
        `);
});
