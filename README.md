Gurshawn's main github repository. Frontend pages for all projects.
Group Projects:
 - Chatting website with built-in games like chess and a 3d target game.
       - My part was frontend and used a frame to create 3d objects and functions to run the game.
 - User friending system with recommendations based on common friends.
       - Created the friending functionality and helped with the recommendation algorithm.
Individual Projects:
    - Clash Royale Data Search
          - uses public api and my own created database
          - takes what the user searches for and populates a frontend table with the information relative to what the user wants.
          - allows the user to save tournaments and their data to their account which appears in another table
    - Clash Royale Prediction algorithm:
          - uses linear regression to determine the winner
          - uses a kaggle dataset
          - user inputs certain stats like their deck elixer and the number of trophies they have
